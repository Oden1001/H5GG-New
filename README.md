# H5GG-New

Based on the existing H5GG source code, optimizations have been made. You can submit requests for new features in the issues section, and I will consider updating accordingly.
Please download the H5GG dylib from [Releases](https://github.com/Oden1001/H5GG-New/releases).

# 2025.9.4 Added New Function

A new function has been added: By calling "h5gg.title();" in JS, you can now customize the title of all alert pop-ups (including system-level dialogs such as input) instead of displaying "index".

Here is an image to illustrate the difference:
